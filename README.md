# Clock Hands Rotation
This project is a simple JavaScript implementation to display a clock with rotating hour, minute, and second hands. The rotation is updated every second using the setInterval function.

# Getting Started

# Copy the JavaScript code into your project file.
Make sure to have the HTML elements with the IDs hour, minute, and second in your HTML file where you want to display the clock hands.

<div id="clock">
  <div id="hour"></div>
  <div id="minute"></div>
  <div id="second"></div>
</div>

1. Adjust the styles and positioning of the clock hands according to your design.

# Usage
Simply include the JavaScript file in your HTML file, and the clock hands will start rotating.
<script src="path/to/your/clock-hands.js"></script>

# Customization
